## Your thought process

- Centralize card state in a parent component (`SimbianDashboard, WithoutSimbianDashboard`)
- Used useState / useEffect / setInterval to simulate alert flow
- Uses Framer Motionâ€™s AnimatePresence + motion.div for enter/exit
- Maintained the component and logic layer separatelay. Ex. `SimbianDashboard` component logic is implemented in `useSimbianDashboard`.
- Used routing for Without Simbian and With Simbion Dashboard.

## Animation library used
- Used the Framer Motion library for the Cards and Icons Animdation

## Any known issues or improvements you would make with more time
- Used the random icons for each alerts
- UX is not matched with the Video
- Could have used the state management library

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
